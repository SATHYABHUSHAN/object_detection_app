Real-Time Object Detection

This Android application demonstrates real-time object detection using a TensorFlow Lite model. It captures video feed from the device's camera, processes the frames using a pre-trained model (`SsdMobilenetV11Metadata1`), and then displays the detected objects with bounding boxes on the screen.

 Features
- Real-time object detection using a TensorFlow Lite model.
- Camera permission handling to access the device's camera.
- Detection results are displayed on the screen with bounding boxes and object labels.
- Utilizes `TextureView` for camera preview and object detection visualization.

 Requirements
- Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher
- TensorFlow Lite model (`SsdMobilenetV11Metadata1`)
- Android permissions for Camera access
